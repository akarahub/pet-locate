Pet Localization

This script implements a pet localization model using TensorFlow and Keras. It leverages a pre-trained VGG16 model as a feature extractor to predict the location and class (dog or cat) of a pet within a randomly generated background image. The model is trained using synthetic data generated on the fly. It combines location (x, y coordinates), class, and appearance (binary) prediction.  The system generates synthetic pet localization data during training and prediction.  It dynamically creates a random background, generates a pet, places it within the background, and creates synthetic bounding box and class labels. This system is designed for prototyping and development, demonstrating the core principles of object detection with a convolutional neural network.
